Please use the library I have uploaded here as I have made changes in them.

In trial 1 I tried using the properties of Yohimbine which is manually added using Antoine's equation 
and I could not get TEA results probably because the cost of yohimbine is not provided in the code or 
due to some other error in the code

In trial 2, solely to get some result in the TEA I basically copied all properties from Ethanol instead.

Please find the report as pdf file and the file that I uploaded for the previous deadline
