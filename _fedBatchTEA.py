    Create a LipidcaneTEA object for techno-economic analysis of a biorefinery [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : System
        Should contain feed and product streams.
    IRR : float
        Internal rate of return (fraction).
    duration : tuple[int, int]
        Start and end year of venture (e.g. (2018, 2038)).
    depreciation : str
        'MACRS' + number of years (e.g. 'MACRS7').
    operating_days : float
        Number of operating days per year.
    income_tax : float
        Combined federal and state income tax rate (fraction).
    lang_factor : float
        Lang factor for getting fixed capital investment from
        total purchase cost. If no lang factor, estimate capital investment
        using bare module factors.
    startup_schedule : tuple[float]
        Startup investment fractions per year
        (e.g. (0.5, 0.5) for 50% capital investment in the first year and 50%
        investment in the second).
    WC_over_FCI : float
        Working capital as a fraction of fixed capital investment.
    labor_cost : float
        Total labor cost (USD/yr).
    fringe_benefits : float
        Cost of fringe benefits as a fraction of labor cost.
    property_tax : float
        Fee as a fraction of fixed capital investment.
    property_insurance : float
        Fee as a fraction of fixed capital investment.
    supplies : float
        Yearly fee as a fraction of labor cost.
    maintenance : float
        Yearly fee as a fraction of fixed capital investment.
    administration : float
        Yearly fee as a fraction of fixed capital investment.
